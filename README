RaceTrackJS provides an easy way to set up Google Analytics on your website. 

Add a reference to the racetrack.js file in the <HEAD> of your document.

After the DOM loads, configure the Tracker object by passing an array of class names to track and actions to track. Ex:

RaceTrackJS.Tracker.configure({
	className: ["ga_test"], // array of classes to track
	toTrack: { // add classes to these arrays that should NOT be tracked for these actions
		click: [], 
		touchend: []
	}
});

Using the above configuration, any clicks or touches on any DOM objects with a class "ga_test" will be tracked. 

The Event Tracking Category will equal the class name.

The Event Tracking Action will equal the action taken plus the class name.

The Event Tracking Label will equal the object's id.

The Event Tracking Value will equal the duration in milliseconds from when the page loaded to when the action was triggered.
